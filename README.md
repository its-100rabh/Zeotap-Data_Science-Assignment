# eCommerce Transactions Analysis

This repository contains the analysis and modeling of an eCommerce transactions dataset. The project involves exploratory data analysis, building a lookalike model, and performing customer segmentation.

## Project Structure

- **Notebooks and Scripts:**
  - `Saurabh_Mahapatra_EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis and insights.
  - `Saurabh_Mahapatra_Lookalike.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for developing the lookalike model.
  - `Saurabh_Mahapatra_Clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for customer segmentation using clustering techniques.

- **Output Files:**
  - `Saurabh_Mahapatra_EDA.pdf`: PDF report summarizing the EDA and business insights.
  - `Saurabh_Mahapatra_Lookalike.csv`: CSV file containing the top 3 lookalike customers for the first 20 customers.
  - `Saurabh_Mahapatra_Clustering.pdf`: PDF report detailing the clustering results and metrics.

## Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Visualizations and insights derived from customer, product, and transaction data.

- **Lookalike Model:**
  - Recommends similar customers based on profile and transaction history using similarity scores.

- **Customer Segmentation:**
  - Clustering techniques applied to segment customers, with evaluation using clustering metrics.
